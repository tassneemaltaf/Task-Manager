# Task Manager

In this project, I was challenged to create a basic task manager for a small business that helps it in managing the tasks of each member of the business's team.
This program works with 5 text files, each one of them stores a different kind of information.

## How it works.

The user is prompted with a main menu once the program is runned. The main menu has 5 options that the user can select from:

* Register user;
* Add task;
* View all tasks;
* View my tasks;
* Generate reports;
* Display statistics;
* Exit;
